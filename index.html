                <p class="versionText">Version 0.2.0 // WIP</p>
                <p class="dateText">????, 2020</p>
                <p class="quoteText">Oh nice. Even more stuff to buy. And a nice little UI revamp.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="categoryText">Major changes:</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>Completely removed the changelog in the game.</b> Instead, it is located here. V0.1.1 was the last version the changelog was in the game, that's why you can see version 0.1.1 here.</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>Removed the donation center button.</b> Now you have an actual donation center you can teleport to when you click the button under the text that says "donation center", which is located on one of the many panels in the spawning area.</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>Added a lot of new buttons.</b> Most of these include new droppers, upgraders and more research. The game now has ?? things you can buy.</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>Completely revamped the UI.</b> I personally don't really like the current UI that this game shows, so I'm deciding to make one that looks pretty good.</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>Changed spawn area and removed those pesky teleporters.</b> Now you spawn on a platform where you can walk to your tycoon to claim it. I feel like it's better this way.</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>The tycoon now has 6 players.</b> This is for those that have 1 - 5 friends (inclusive) that they would like to play with. The new colors will be "hot pink" and "deep orange".</p>
                <br>
                <p class="categoryText">Minor changes:</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>A 30-second forcefield for players that join the server.</b> This is so other players that have weapons can't kill you until you own a tycoon.</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - <b>Added a "$/sec" display.</b> This is mostly for those math nerds out there that would love to calculate how much money they get every minute / hour / day, etc.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="categoryText">Bug fixes:</p>
                <p class="changesText"> - Fixed a bug <b>where you spawn in the center and not on your tycoon's spawnpoint.</b></p>
